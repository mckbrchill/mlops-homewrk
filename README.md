# TASK 2
## Here is s3 bucket for the home task.
`s3://otus-task-n2/`

## Here is the path to Jupyter notebook with s3loader code and extracted script.
`./notebooks/chaos/load_to_s3.ipynb`
`./src/scripts/s3loader.py`

## And this screenshot shows the copy of data in hdfs

# TASK 3
## S3 bucket with the prepocessed data
`s3://otus-task-n3/`

## The data preprocessing is described in Jupyter notebook
`./notebooks/reports/fraud_data_cleaing.ipynb`
## Here is the path to the data prepocessing / cleaning script made from the prev notebook.
`./src/scripts/clean_fraud_data.py`


# TASK 4
## 3 successful DAG runs in a row

## VMs for dataproc

## DataProc for AirFlow

# TASK 5
## 3 successful DAG runs in a row with model training. Although I skipped data preprocessing to save some time.

## All runs in MLFLOW - last several ones ar–µ successful

## Metrics in MLFlow for DAG task

## Metrics in MLFlow for manual training script execution 
![metrcis for manual](/static/screenshots/mlflow-training2.JPG)
## Model artifacts in mlflow
![model artifacts mlflow](/static/screenshots/mlflow-training3.JPG)
## Model artifacts in S3

# TASK 6

## I've implemented AB-testing through statistical difference measure for all the metrics for the new trained model (for educational purpose to save some time the number of bootstap samples is low). 

## Metrics distributions saved in MLFlow (mean, std, confidence interval, p-value, z-score)
